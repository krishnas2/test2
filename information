Hi Rama,

PFB the list of checks that need to be done on the Vlocity Objects. We are still working on Integration procedures and Omniscripts.
We can classify the items in below list optional and mandatory so that they a CICD admin can choose to run Only Mandatory checks or can include optional checks as part of the Code Quality Check.

Accordingly we can define a score against each objects and thus an overall Code Quality score.

We can have a call to walkthrough on the below list.

DataRaptor:
1.	Salesforce Object Validation (Object Visibility, Object Permissions, Field Visibility, Field Permissions refer to the node "%vlocity_namespace%__CheckFieldLevelSecurity__c" in the dataraptor extract)
2.	Presence of "%vlocity_namespace%__SampleInputJSON__c"  node in the DataRaptor extract and it being not null
3.	When Load Raptor, 
a.	then check if all the required fields are being populated
b.	If at least one field is an Upsert Key which is not disabled
4.	If a DataRaptor is used to insert objects like Cases / Incidents / Service Requests / Activities / Opportunities  then Use Assignment Rules flag has to be checked ( viz: when inserting any object with Assignment rules defined / Applicable)
5.	When running the DataRaptor in a Batch Mode (if applicable) then Ignore Errors has to be recommended
6.	When running the DataRaptor in transactional mode, Rollback On Error has to be recommended 
7.	Naming Convention validations (Project recommendations + Vlocity Recommendations)
 
Template
1.	Ensure active version of the template is present.
2.	Run JS validator, HTML Validator and CSS Validator on the template
3.	Is a preview executed for the active version?
4.	Naming Convention validations (Project recommendations + Vlocity Recommendations)
5.	Validate any template references by identifying the tag/attribute: ng-include (all the validation of the template can be applicable to referred template as well)
6.	The Controller Name in the HTML template should match the controller name on the JS of this template
7.	Validate any static resources used
8.	Can restrict the number of lines of comments in the template
9.	Validate the use of any global variables, the use of merge codes for static binding and two-way binding (if recommended at solution level)
10.	Recommend the use of SLDS based on the tags used: Eg: Buttons: slds-button etc
 
Vlocity Card/Console
1.	Is a Data Source set for the Card Layout?
2.	Naming Convention validations (Project recommendations + Vlocity Recommendations)
3.	Validate Vlocity Action used in the card.
4.	Salesforce Object Validation (Object Visibility, Object Permissions, Field Visibility, Field Permissions)
5.	Card and Card Layout template validation
 
Vlocity Action
1.	Is the Vlocity Action active?
2.	Validate the fields: Display On, Open URL in, Link Type, Target URL and URL Parameter (if Target URL contains parameters), Display sequence

Thanks Arjun. Let us start off with below list and I would like to add integration is a separate piece, not generic one but purely for vlocity specific

Later we can add dependencies as well

Subject: Non-Functional checks on Vlocity Objects

Hi Srujana,

Rama is looking for basic Non-functional checks that would be good to run as a code quality check on below list of objects.
We need to come up with the list of such checks. 3
Few examples stated below:

1.	DataRaptor
Example: 
Check1: Does Extract raptor have Extract Object and fields specified ?
Check2: Is a success preview executed at least once ?
2.	Template
Example:
Check1: Is the template active ?
3.	Vlocity Card/Console
4.	Vlocity Action
5.	Integration Procedure
6.	Omniscript

@Rama: Please add any other objects to the list, if I had missed to highlight.

 
Thanks

Hi Rama,

PFB the list of checks that need to be done on Integration procedures and Omniscripts.

Integration Procedure
1.      Is the IP version active?
2.      Naming Convention validations (Project recommendations + Vlocity Recommendations)
3.      When using DataRaptor Extract Action, if DataRaptor expects a filter, it has to be passed by the IP
4.      When using DataRaptor Post Action, if DataRaptor expects a Payload, it has to be passed by the IP
5.      Run all the IP checks on any IP referenced by the current IP using Integration Procedure Action
6.      When using a Remote Action, the corresponding apex class (if not a managed class) can be validated for the presence of apex test class and code coverage
7.      There should be atleast one response action
8.      For a HTTP Action
a.      The URL has to be registered in Remote Site Settings
b.      If a Named Credential is used, then it has to be validated for a Valid Auth. Provider (if applicable)
c.       Time Out, retries and Error handlers have to be configured based on the solution recommendations
9.      Is a success preview executed at least once ?
 
Omniscript
1.       Is the Omniscript version active?
2.      Naming Convention validations for Omniscript Header and Elements (Project recommendations + Vlocity Recommendations)
3.      Ensure the child Omniscripts embedded and Integration Procedures have an active version.
4.      Is there an active version of templates which are referred in the Omniscript?
5.      To use a PDF Action, an existing fillable PDF must exist in Documents.
6.      All IP checks are valid for Omniscript since IP is a server side version of Omniscript
7.      Based on Solution level Standards validate below
a.      Specific Templates for specific elements
b.      Save Options
c.       Any other configurations like a mandatory salutation page, Summary Page for any order, Validation Required Option to be set to Submit/step/none and Persistent components required on Reusable Omniscripts or Omniscripts
8.      Run all checks for individual type of elements such as DataRaptor, IP or Reusable Omniscript


Thanks,
Srujana Durvasula.

Good Arjun. Let us classify as warnings and Errors. So that we can build rules around them

Hi KK,

   Good work on building this tool in quick notice and also being able to host on heroku as well . It helps us in demonstrating the tool to clients. Let us complete this tool in coming weeks so that it can be showcase to vlocity/Telstra as well.

Let us try to include few more checks by tomorrow so that we can showcase this as part of the client visit in hyderbad.

Matt,

  I will upload the latest webex tonight or tomorrow once we add some more checks and as well as change few UI elements on the tool(ex : change logs messaging)

Thanks,

Subject: RE: Sample Dataraptor with Preview parameters

Hi Rama,

Please Find attached JSON file that can be used for uploading org details.

App is hosted at : https://kkj-uttestapp.herokuapp.com

Source Code: https://github.com/krishnas2/testing

NOTE: 
1. I am able to overcome proxy issue as I have found a way to automatically deploy edited code to heroku by establishing link with github. As soon as code in github gets updated heroku app will be refreshed. 
2. I am planning to migrate this to a new heroku domain with a meaningful name to website.

Regards,
KK
